    "I started by reading in all the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` images.  \n",

    "\n",
    "I then explored different color spaces and different `skimage.hog()` parameters (`orientations`, `pixels_per_cell`, and `cells_per_block`).  I grabbed random images from each of the two classes and displayed them to get a feel for what the `skimage.hog()` output looks like.\n",

We found out that the combination of `orientations=9`, `pix_per_cell = 6 or 8`, `cell_per_block = 2 or 3` results in a good performance and `color_space = HSV or HLS` are also good ones. So, we ended up having  `orientations=9`, `pix_per_cell = 8`, `cell_per_block = 2`, and `color_space = HLS`.\n",

Once the dataset is prepared, we split it into training and validation datasets with random selection applied. We use `train_test_split` function from the `sklearn` library.

So, we decide to adjust the window size based on the position where the vehicle sizes are differently shown. We first determine the minimum and maximum sizes of windows and position them to near the center of the whole image and close to the vehicle, respectively. Then two more intermediate sizes are positioned in between. One thing we found out important is that the centers of the windows of the four different sizes are to be on the same horizontal line. Unless otherwise the smooth transition of detection windows will not work well. The corresponding sliding window search result is shown in the following:\n",

In order to reduce and remove false positives and duplated detection, we use a heatmap presented in the course. There are two key functions called add_heat and apply_threshold.\n",

Windows of small size are postioned to the center and large ones cover the area near to the vehicle. Although it works, false positives still remain. As mentioned earlier, we originally planed to use blob detection and watershed, but couldn't figure out how. This is what I may have to improve for the future."
