## Computer Vision and Deep Learning

In this term, I learn and apply Computer Vision and Deep Learning on automotive problems. I teach the car to detect lane lines, predict steering angle, and more all based on just camera data.

* Finding Lane Lines on the Road
* Traffic Sign Classifier
* Behavioral Cloning
* Advanced Lane Finding
* Vehicle Detection and Tracking

## Sensor Fusion, Localization, and Control

In this term, I learn how to use an array of sensor data to perceive the environment and control the vehicle. I evaluate sensor data from camera, radar, lidar, and GPS, and use these in closed-loop controllers that actuate the vehicle.

* Extended Kalman Filters
* Unscented Kalman Filters
* Kidnapped Vehicle
* PID Controller
* Model Predictive Control

## Path Planning, Concentrations, and Systems

In this term, I learn how to plan where the vehicle should go, how the vehicle systems work together to get it there, and I perform a deep-dive into a concentration of your choice.

* Path Planning Project
* Semantic Segmentation
* Functional Safety of a Lane Assistance System
* Programming a Real Self-Driving Car
